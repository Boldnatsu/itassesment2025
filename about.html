                Hi, I’m Bold Jung Poudel, the founder of BIGWASH, and a lifelong biking enthusiast with a passion for clean rides and quality service. What started as a simple weekend routine of detailing my own bike turned into a full-fledged idea to help others keep their rides looking and performing at their best. <br><br>
                I launched BIGWASH with a vision to bring professional, affordable, and eco-friendly bike wash services to riders who care about their machines as much as I do. With a background in mechanical work, customer service, and entrepreneurship, I’ve combined technical knowledge and a love for bikes to create a service that’s fast, reliable, and driven by detail. <br><br>
                For me, it’s not just about cleaning bikes—it’s about building a community of riders who value care, maintenance, and pride in ownership. Every service we offer reflects the same level of attention and dedication I’d give to my own ride.
                <br><br>
                Thanks for being part of the journey. Let’s keep your bike looking as good as the day you got it.
